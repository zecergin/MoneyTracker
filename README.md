# Software Engineers Blog


https://dbse-teaching.github.io/isee2019-SpicyPi/

This is the main page of your repository for the course project that is a center piece of the lecture "Introduction to Software Engineering for Engineers" in summer term 2019.

In this lecture, each student group needs to report on the project progress via **Blog entries and weekly status reports**. 
We will link all Blogs as far as they are set up (presumably in the 3rd week of the semester).
Moreover, each student group will use Github to host the source code and showing their contributions by frequent commits to all kind of artifacts.
Apart from that, you are also free to use your Github repository for further documents or deliverables you would like to share among your team members.
